## Introduction

[Self contained systems](scs-architecutre.org) - SCS is a decomposition style, where a set of verticals forms a system. Each vertical being a independent self contained system.
It favours UI integration trough composition, where each vertical owns all interfaces/UI, aligning service and UI ownership. 
SCS it self doen't imply witch composition style to use.

Using this approch avoids a monolithic frontend with it's pros and cons.
Each vertical could then use an architecture and tech stack suitable for it's needs.
