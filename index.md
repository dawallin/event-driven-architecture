In this article we'll explore EDA through mainly "Event-based State Transfer", [Martin Fowler's event patterns](https://martinfowler.com/videos.html#many-meanings-event).
In the examples services/compontents will collaborate through events. The service/component defention we're using is as follows.

### Service / Component

Each service could react to events, handle requests/response and emit events.
Requests could be commands or queries. Responses could be only status codes or results, the request/response could by sync or async, eventual consistent or not. The defenition stays the same and these options are implementation details.

### Logs

This article will also look at integration between services using logs.

Log characteristics as append only, ordered events (in partion) and offsets, could easaly be compared with a file(s). Pushing position and ack/"checkpointing" to the clients, removing broker concepts centraliced subscriptions and deadletter etc.

Using logs as integration or/and as a form of persitant model, introduces new patterns when working with events. These options are going to be explored further in this article.
